**the game you never wanted**
**but you have it anyway lol**

## about:
this game started out as a little project of mine, and i would work on it every once in a while.
now, its in **alpha**, and i'd say its a pretty fun game!

oh yeah, when you launch the game, you'll get an error, saying "windows protected your pc".
that's because it isn't signed. signing it would cost me **upwards of 300$ a year**.
the game is completely safe, feel free to read the code.

## complicated stuffs:

the game is created in **batch**, which can **ONLY run on windows**.
however, **im working on a pack for linux and macOS**, so watch out for that.

when you start the game for the first time, you'll need to enter a **setup process**.
this setup process drops some files for saving in **"C:\Users\<username>\ThatTemp\BCG\"**
if you'd like to reset without using the ingame reset features, you can just delete that folder.
